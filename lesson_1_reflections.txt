1. Why reflection?
By comparing the two versions of the same projects, it is easier
to detect typos.

2. How entire history make you more efficient programmer?
It helps you to be aware of the learning process.

3. What are the pros and cons of manually chossing when to create
a commit?
Pros: You have the control and flexibility

4. Why Git allows saving multiple files in one commit?
It will be especially useful and convenient if multiple files 
are relevant and connected in the same repository.

We should first find the commit ids that we are interested to 
compare, and then copy past to the git diff command.

Pretty confident since I cannot mess things up anymore.
