1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to publish codes and collaborative with other people.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case I reverted the current to old versions on Github.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks only allow copy from otherâ€™s github to your github. Clones allow copy from your 
github to your local computer. Branches allow copy of commits within one repositary.
